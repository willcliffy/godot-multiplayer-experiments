## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

**This is the version 4 of ProtonScatter. It's only compatible with Godot 4.**

If you're looking for a version compatible with Godot 3.x, check the releases
page or the legacy branch.

V4 is currently being ported from v2.8.x, but it's **breaking compatibility**
due to core changes. You will have to redo your scatter nodes when
moving to v4. (I might write a conversion script if it's technically possible
and not too time consuming but that will have to wait until v4 is stable)
